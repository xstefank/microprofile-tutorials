== What is MicroProifle

link:https://microprofile.io/[MicroProfile] (a.k.a Eclipse MicroProfile) is an open-source specification that facilitates the development of microservices using enterprise Java technologies. It defines a set of APIs and specifications for building modern, scalable, resilient, and efficient applications based on microservices architecture. The primary goal of MicroProfile is to simplify the development process for Java developers, enabling them to create applications optimized for cloud-native development.

A consortium of industry leaders and Java community members, including organizations such as IBM, Red Hat, Payara, Tomitribe, and individual contributors collaborating within an open source link:https://www.eclipse.org/org/workinggroups/about.php[Eclipse Foundation Working Group], developed MicroProfile. This collaborative approach ensured that MicroProfile was shaped by diverse experiences and requirements, making it a robust and versatile specification extending Java in cloud-computing domain. 

== Need for MicroProfile

The emergence of microservices architectures has introduced unique challenges for developers. MicroProfile aims to address these challenges by providing a streamlined and optimized set of APIs tailored explicitly for building and deploying microservices-based applications in Java. The MicroProfile Specification was created to cater to the following needs:

- *Microservices Architecture Adoption*: As the industry shifted towards microservices architecture for its flexibility, scalability, and speed of deployment, there was a growing need for a standard framework tailored to this architectural style, especially in the Java ecosystem.

- *Limitations of Traditional Enterprise Java*: Traditional enterprise Java frameworks, like Java EE (now Jakarta EE), were often seen as too monolithic and heavyweight for microservices. This led to a demand for a more streamlined and microservices-focused framework.

- *Cloud-Native Application Development*: The rise of cloud-native applications required features like external configuration, health checks, and fault tolerance. Existing Java standards did not adequately address these.

- *Community-Driven Innovation*: The Java community saw the need for a platform where they could collaboratively develop and innovate rapidly to keep up with the fast-paced changes in technology and microservice's best practices.

- *Vendor Neutrality and Interoperability*: There was a need for a vendor-neutral framework that could provide standardization across different implementations and environments, ensuring compatibility and avoiding vendor lock-in.

- *Focus on Simplicity and Productivity*: Developers needed a simple and easy-to-understand framework that increased productivity by reducing boilerplate code and focusing on essential microservice functionalities. Well-defined standards and patterns eliminate the need to reinvent the wheel, allowing developers to focus on microservices logic.

- *Integration with Existing Java Ecosystems*: It was crucial to have a framework that could integrate smoothly with existing Java ecosystems like Jakarta EE, leveraging the strengths of these platforms while extending their capabilities to support microservices.

- *Emphasis on Lightweight and Resilient Services*: With the microservices architecture, there's a need for frameworks that support the development of lightweight, resilient, and independently deployable services, which are essential for microservices.

- *Rapid Adaptation to New Trends*: The technology landscape, especially around microservices, is constantly evolving. A framework like MicroProfile, which is community-driven and rapidly evolving, can adapt quickly to these changes, continually incorporating new practices and technologies.

- *Enhanced Observability and Monitoring*: Microservices architectures complicate application monitoring and observability. A framework with built-in support for these capabilities simplifies the management of distributed services.

== MicroProfile Specifications

== Relationship with Jakarta EE specification 
While Jakarta EE is the broader umbrella under which everything under enterprise Java now falls, MicroProfile specializes in microservices. MicroProfile is not a replacement but rather a supplement to Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE), focusing on microservices-specific features. The two are complementary, with MicroProfile building on the Jakarta EE standards and adding additional capabilities required for microservices architectures. This synergy allows developers to leverage the robustness of Jakarta EE while utilizing MicroProfile for microservices-specific features.
