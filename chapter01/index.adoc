== Chapter 1: Introduction to MicroProfile

=== Introduction 

This chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of the MicroProfile platform to ensure a deep understanding of its architecture, 
specifications, and key features. It provides a solid foundation for understanding the MicroProfile platform, 
its purpose, and its place in the broader context of Java enterprise development. It covers its benefits, 
its relationship with Jakarta EE, and how it supports cloud-native application development.

=== Topics to be covered:
- What is MicroProfile 
- Need for MicroProfile (How it addresses the needs for microservices development)
- Benefits of MicroProfile (This section would focus on advantages of using MicroProfile, vendor-neutrality and standardization)
- Relationship with Jakarta EE specification (How MicroProfile complements Jakarta EE, and focuses on integration and interoperability.
- Cloud-Native Development with MicroProfile (characteristics of cloud-native application, how microprofile facilitates cloud-native development) 

=== What is MicroProifle

MicroProfile is an open-source specification specifically designed for developing microservices based applications in Java. It addresses the challenges and complexities of building scalable, resilient, and efficient microservices by providing a suite of well-defined APIs and specifications. This platform's goal is to simplify the development for Java developers enabling them to create applications that are optimized for cloud-native development.

Developed by a consortium of industry leaders and Java community members, it extends the capabilities of Java in the cloud computing domain. The founding members included prominent organizations like IBM, Red Hat, Payara, Tomitribe, and others, along with individual contributors from the Java community. This collective approach ensured that MicroProfile was shaped by a diverse set of experiences and requirements, making it robust and versatile. 

==== Key Specifications
MicroProfile comprises several specifications that address various aspects of microservices development:

- *Config:* Provides externalized configuration management.
- *Fault Tolerance:* Deals with resilience and stability.
- *Health Check:* Enables monitoring of microservice health.
- *Metrics:* Facilitates gathering and exporting of metrics data.
- *OpenAPI:* Supports creating OpenAPI documents for RESTful APIs.
- *OpenTracing:* Integrates distributed tracing.
- *Rest Client:* Simplifies invoking RESTful services.
- *JWT Propagation:* Manages JSON Web Tokens for secure microservices communication.

Each of these specifications solves specific microservices challenges, such as configuration management, fault tolerance, and service monitoring.

=== Architecture Philosophy 

The architecture of MicroProfile is based on the following core principles:
1. Modularity: Its modular approach allows developers to use only what they need, reducing the overhead typically associated with enterprise frameworks.
2. Standards-based: It ensures compatibility and consistency across different implementations.
3. Community-driven: It encouraging active participation from the Java community for continuous evolution.

The goal of the project was to build a lightweight enterprise-grade framework tailored for building cloud-native applications. 

=== Need for MicroProfile

=== Benefits of MicroProfile
1. Lightweight and Modular: Perfect for microservices architecture.
2. Enhanced Productivity: Simplifies microservices development with a set of standard APIs.
3. Cloud-Native Oriented: MicroProfile is inherently designed for cloud-native applications, supporting containerization and orchestration. MicroProfile's compatibility with container technologies like Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes makes it a go-to choice for cloud-based Java applications.
4. Community Support: Backed by a strong Java community, ensuring continuous improvement and support.

=== Relationship with Jakarta EE specification 
While Jakarta EE is the broader umbrella under which everything under enterprise Java now falls, MicroProfile specializes in microservices. MicroProfile is not a replacement but rather a supplement to Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE), focusing on microservices-specific features. The two are complementary, with MicroProfile building on the Jakarta EE standards and adding additional capabilities required for microservices architectures. This synergy allows developers to leverage the robustness of Jakarta EE while utilizing MicroProfile for microservices-specific features.
