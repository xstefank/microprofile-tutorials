=== What is MicroProifle

MicroProfile (a.k.a Eclipse MicroProfile) is an open-source specification that facilitates the development of microservices using enterprise Java technologies. It defines a set of APIs and specifications for building modern, scalable, resilient, and efficient applications based on microservices architecture. The primary goal of MicroProfile is to simplify the development process for Java developers, enabling them to create applications optimized for cloud-native development.

It was developed by a consortium of industry leaders and Java community members, including organizations like IBM, Red Hat, Payara, Tomitribe, and individual contributors. This collaborative approach ensured that MicroProfile was shaped by diverse experiences and requirements, making it a robust and versatile specification extending Java in cloud-computing domain. 

==== Key Specifications
The table below provides a list of key specifications of MicroProfile along with their descriptions:

|=======================
|Specification          |Description
|Config                 |Provides a way for applications to configure themselves dynamically by reading configuration data from various sources.
|Fault Tolerance        |Implements patterns like Circuit Breaker, Bulkhead, Retry, Timeout, and Fallback to create resilient microservices.
|JWT Authentication     |Defines a standard for using JSON Web Tokens for authentication and authorization in microservices for secure communication.
|Metrics                |Enables applications to expose telemetry data to external monitoring systems, providing insights into their performance.
|Health Check           |Allows applications to signal their health and readiness to perform operations, crucial for automated recovery in cloud environments.
|OpenAPI                |Facilitates the generation of OpenAPI documentation for RESTful services, making API discovery and understanding easier.
|OpenTracing            |Integrates distributed tracing into microservices, improving observability and diagnostics in complex architectures.
|Rest Client            |Defines a type-safe approach to invoke RESTful services over HTTP(S), simplifying the development of HTTP clients.
|=======================

Each of these specifications solves specific microservices challenges, such as configuration management, fault tolerance, and service monitoring.

=== Architecture Philosophy 

The architecture of MicroProfile is based on the following core principles with the overall goal to to build a lightweight enterprise-grade framework tailored for building cloud-native applications, and enabling developers to easily build and deploy microservices with Java:

- *Simplicity*: MicroProfile APIs are designed to be simple and easy to use. They avoid unnecessary complexity and focus on providing the essential functionality needed for building microservices.

- *Modularity*: Its modular approach allows developers to use only what they need, reducing the overhead typically associated with enterprise frameworks.

- *Standards-based*: MicroProfile is based on open standards and specifications. This ensures compatibility and consistency across different implementations.

- *Community-driven*: It encourages active participation from the Java community for continuous evolution.

- *Vendor-Neutral*: As an Eclipse Foundation project, MicroProfile is vendor-neutral. It's supported by a range of industry players, ensuring that no single company controls its direction.

- *Focus on Cloud-Native Applications*: The architecture is specifically tailored for cloud environments. It includes features such as externalized configuration, fault tolerance, health checks, and metrics. These features are essential for developing resilient and scalable cloud-native applications. 

- *Reactive programming*: MicroProfile supports reactive programming, which is a style of programming that is well-suited for building microservices. Reactive applications are responsive and scalable, and they can handle high volumes of concurrent requests.

=== Need for MicroProfile

The need for MicroProfile arises from several key factors in modern software development, particularly in the context of building and deploying microservices-based applications in Java:

- *Microservices Architecture Adoption*: As the industry shifted towards microservices architecture for its flexibility, scalability, and speed of deployment, there was a growing need for a standard framework tailored to this architectural style, especially in the Java ecosystem.

- *Limitations of Traditional Enterprise Java*: Traditional enterprise Java frameworks, like Java EE (now Jakarta EE), were often seen as too monolithic and heavyweight for the dynamic and lightweight nature of microservices. This led to a demand for a more streamlined and microservices-focused framework.

- *Cloud-Native Application Development*: The rise of cloud-native applications required features like external configuration, health checks, and fault tolerance, which were not adequately addressed by existing Java standards.

- *Community-Driven Innovation*: The Java community saw the need for a platform where they could collaboratively develop and innovate rapidly to keep up with the fast-paced changes in technology and microservices best practices.

- *Vendor Neutrality and Interoperability*: There was a need for a vendor-neutral framework that could provide standardization across different implementations and environments, ensuring compatibility and avoiding vendor lock-in.

- *Focus on Simplicity and Productivity*: Developers needed a framework that was simple to use, easy to understand, and that increased productivity by reducing boilerplate code and focusing on essential microservices functionalities.

- *Integration with Existing Java Ecosystems*: It was crucial to have a framework that could integrate smoothly with existing Java ecosystems like Jakarta EE, leveraging the strengths of these platforms while extending their capabilities to support microservices.

- *Emphasis on Lightweight and Resilient Services*: With the microservices architecture, there's a need for frameworks that support the development of lightweight, resilient, and independently deployable services, which are essential characteristics for microservices.

- *Rapid Adaptation to New Trends*: The technology landscape, especially around microservices, is constantly evolving. A framework like MicroProfile, which is community-driven and rapidly evolving, can adapt quickly to these changes, continually incorporating new practices and technologies.

- *Enhanced Observability and Monitoring*: Microservices architectures complicate application monitoring and observability. A framework with built-in support for these capabilities simplifies the management of distributed services.

=== Benefits of MicroProfile
1. Lightweight and Modular: Perfect for microservices architecture.
2. Enhanced Productivity: Simplifies microservices development with a set of standard APIs.
3. Cloud-Native Oriented: MicroProfile is inherently designed for cloud-native applications, supporting containerization and orchestration. MicroProfile's compatibility with container technologies like Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes makes it a go-to choice for cloud-based Java applications.
4. Community Support: Backed by a strong Java community, ensuring continuous improvement and support.

=== Relationship with Jakarta EE specification 
While Jakarta EE is the broader umbrella under which everything under enterprise Java now falls, MicroProfile specializes in microservices. MicroProfile is not a replacement but rather a supplement to Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE), focusing on microservices-specific features. The two are complementary, with MicroProfile building on the Jakarta EE standards and adding additional capabilities required for microservices architectures. This synergy allows developers to leverage the robustness of Jakarta EE while utilizing MicroProfile for microservices-specific features.
