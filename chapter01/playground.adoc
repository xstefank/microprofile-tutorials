== Overview

MicroProfile, also known as xref:microprofile[Eclipse MicroProfile], is an open-source specification that aids in the development of microservices using xref:enterprise-java-technologies[enterprise Java technologies]. It offers a suite of xref:apis[APIs] and xref:specifications[specifications] designed for building modern, xref:scalability[scalable], xref:resilience[resilient], and xref:efficiency[efficient] applications geared towards xref:microservices-architecture[microservices architecture]. The initiative focuses on simplifying the Java development process, particularly for xref:cloud-native-development[cloud-native applications].

== Glossary

Here's a glossary of key terms related to MicroProfile to help understand its concepts and benefits:

[glossary]
[[microprofile]]
MicroProfile (Eclipse MicroProfile):: An open-source community specification that provides a set of APIs and standards for developing microservices-based applications using Java EE technologies.

[[microservices-architecture]]
Microservices Architecture:: An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, autonomous services modeled around a business domain.

[[enterprise-java-technologies]]
Enterprise Java Technologies:: Java platforms and frameworks targeted for use in enterprise environments, such as Java EE (now Jakarta EE), which include a wide range of capabilities such as web services, security, concurrency, and transaction management.

[[apis]]
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):: Interfaces provided by a computer system, library, or application to allow requests for services to be made of it by other computer programs, and/or to allow data to be exchanged between them.

[[specifications]]
Specifications:: Defined requirements to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service. In the context of MicroProfile, these are the standards and APIs that guide the development of microservices applications.

[[cloud-native-development]]
Cloud-Native Development:: An approach to building and running applications that exploit the advantages of the cloud computing delivery model. Cloud-native is about how applications are created and deployed, not where.

[[scalability]]
Scalability:: The capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.

[[resilience]]
Resilience:: The ability of a system to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults and challenges to normal operation.

[[efficiency]]
Efficiency:: In the context of software and systems, efficiency refers to the effective use of system resources (such as memory, processing power, and network bandwidth) and optimizing performance.
