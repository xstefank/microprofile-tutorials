# MicroProfile Tutorial
[MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/) Tutorial Content - this repository contains the source files that are used to build the _MicroProfie API Tutorial_. The source files are authored in [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org/). AsciiDoc is similar to markdown but is particularly suited for user documentation. The source files are processed and integrated into the Jakarta EE Documentation site using [Antora](https://antora.org/), which is a tool for building documentation sites.

You can always find the most recent build of the Jakarta EE Documentation site here: 
[MicroPofile Documentation](https://microprofile.github.io/microprofile-documentation/microprofile-tutorial/current/index.html). 

## A Note about Images

We keep the source files (VSD) and the published format (SVG)
for images in the `src/main/antora/modules/common/images` folder. 
However, currently all the source file names don't match their corresponding SVG file. 
If you modify a source image, 
please help us out and rename it to match the output image.

Guidelines for generating new images can be found in the [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
